# Cantilever-Beam-Test

Simulation and Analysis: cantilever_beam.py

Input files:
- cylinder_X.msh files are the object inputs (X stands for mesh size. number of meshes are: 1k, 3k, 22k). Save input objects in src/share/mesh
- physicsval_parameters.txt has all the simulation parameters, such as young's modulus, force, CGLinearSolver iterations... Save the file in the same directory as cantilever_beam.py
